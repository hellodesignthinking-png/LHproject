# ⚙️ Option C - Week 2 Execution Guide
## ZeroSite v24.1 - 70% → 85% Enhancement Phase

**Duration**: 7 days (Days 8-14)  
**Goal**: Implement 2-3 high-priority GAPs based on Week 1 feedback  
**Target**: 85% project completion  
**Status**: Awaiting Week 1 feedback analysis

---

## 📊 Week 1 Results (Prerequisites)

### **Required Inputs from Week 1**
Before starting Week 2, you must have:

1. **Usage Metrics** (`week1_final.json`):
   - Total reports generated
   - Multi-parcel analyses performed
   - Feature usage breakdown
   - Performance metrics
   - Error logs and issues

2. **User Feedback** (`feedback_week1.json`):
   - Feature requests (ranked by frequency)
   - Pain points and complaints
   - Satisfaction ratings
   - User interviews summary

3. **Week 2 Priorities** (generated by `collect_feedback.py --week2-priorities`):
   - Top 2-3 GAPs to implement
   - Prioritization score (user demand + business impact)
   - Estimated implementation time

### **Example Week 1 Results**

```json
{
  "usage_metrics": {
    "total_reports": 127,
    "multi_parcel_analyses": 43,
    "avg_satisfaction": 4.3,
    "top_features": [
      "Multi-Parcel Optimization (43 uses)",
      "Financial Waterfall Chart (89 uses)",
      "Capacity Mass Sketch (67 uses)"
    ]
  },
  "top_user_requests": [
    {"request": "Dashboard UI upgrade", "count": 34, "gap": "#8"},
    {"request": "2024 zoning regulations", "count": 28, "gap": "#9"},
    {"request": "Better 3D visualization", "count": 22, "gap": "#12"},
    {"request": "Enhanced narrative reports", "count": 19, "gap": "#11"},
    {"request": "Multi-source data", "count": 12, "gap": "#10"}
  ],
  "week2_priorities": [
    {"gap": "#8", "score": 92, "hours": 8},
    {"gap": "#9", "score": 78, "hours": 3},
    {"gap": "#12", "score": 65, "hours": 5}
  ]
}
```
